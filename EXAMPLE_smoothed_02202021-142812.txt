And welcome to episode nine of the Good Gamer Society podcast. This is Brandon, otherwise known as Lord Nerevar 76. I'm here with my traditional cohosts artaman teoti, otherwise known as Andrew.

00:00:20 Andrew (tamantayoshi)

So.

00:00:21 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

And my cousin Alex, otherwise wants some Deutsch.

00:00:25 Alex (somedoinks)

Whatever I like how I enjoy is his actual name is Samantha Yoshi.

00:00:30 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

Yeah, I know I I completely reversed the yeah the thing, so that's my bad. That's true actually there. But in any case, this is a special kind of like a special quick, not quick but reaction episode to the Nintendo Direct from February what was at 17 eighteen 17.

00:00:50 Andrew (tamantayoshi)

17 with me something.

00:00:53 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

Is it'll just be remembered as the direct that came after a 1 1/2 year hiatus. So Oh yeah.

00:00:53 Alex (somedoinks)

Thanks.

00:00:58 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

So.

00:00:59 Andrew (tamantayoshi)

But we didn't really two days.

00:01:01 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

When we were just some people that crap direct, but I'll get into that.

00:01:06 Alex (somedoinks)

Again, right?

00:01:06 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

Not necessarily to me, but I think at least one of those feels that way. And in any case. Sorry. Let's just jump into this. Yeah, we're just going to basically be thinking the Nintendo Direct, and I did want to point out this is the only other piece of news I'll talk about. Is that just a couple hours ago? Diablo 2. 2A remaster for Diablo two got announced for PC and all consoles, including Switch, so that's pretty awesome.

00:01:31 Alex (somedoinks)

Came here to find this.

00:01:38 Andrew (tamantayoshi)

That is pretty dope.

00:01:39 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

I don't know if you guys have played any of that. Or whatever.

00:01:43 Alex (somedoinks)

I have not be honest.

00:01:45 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

Yeah, Diablo two is considered like a all time classic. It kind of kicked off that whole genre of life. Only come out. 1998 or five or two 2000 actually I think.

00:01:55 Alex (somedoinks)

Oh

00:01:57 Andrew (tamantayoshi)

When I think about.

00:01:59 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

He doesn't in eight or something he doesn't add. 13

00:02:04 Andrew (tamantayoshi)

Ah, I saw a little later than I do.

00:02:06 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

They're very long lasting games, but Diablo two is sort of like a past.

00:02:09 Alex (somedoinks)

I thought they were done.

00:02:11 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

But yeah, they redid it with like pretty good graphics and stuff. So excited 'cause that's on my great campaign list so.

00:02:18 Andrew (tamantayoshi)

It would also bring in Arcade Thing, but then things really started model today to know.

00:02:24 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

Oh, I think I saw something about that. I'm not sure would be in it, but.

00:02:28 Alex (somedoinks)

Yeah.

00:02:29 Brandon (LordNerevar76)

All right, so in that case, let's just jump right into this. It was the first intent of direct and like you said, major 532 days. There were a couple of relatively big announcements, but I guess let's just kind of walk through the whole direct. If you guys are done with that. Without a permit. Let's let's do it all right so well, Andrews got this organized here. Sure.
